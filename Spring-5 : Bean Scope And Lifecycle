Spring Bean Scope


1. Bean lifetime
2. No of instances of bean created
3. How is the bean shared ?

Default scope : singleton
-------------------------
1. Only one instance of the bean is created. 

2. It is cached in the memory and all request for bean will return a shared reference
to the same bean.

3. Best usage is when you dont reqd to maintain the state of a bean.

{	Coach trackCoach = context.getBean("trackCoach", Coach.class); ----------->

	Coach alphaTrackCoach = context.getBean("trackCoach", Coach.class); ------> both shares the same ref to "trackCoach" bean.

	<bean id="" class="" scope="singleton">
}

Scopes					Usage

singleton					single shared instance. Default

prototype					create a new bean instance for each container request. (context.getBean() : new bean instance)

request					scoped to HTTP req. Only used for web apps

session					scoped to HTTP session. Only used for web apps

global-session				scoped to global HTTP session. Only used for web apps


Bean Lifecycle
--------------

Spring Container Started >> Bean Instantiated >> Dependencies Injected >> Internal Spring Process With Bean Factory

>> Custom Init Method >> Do Work >> Custom Destroy Work >> Application closed.

( XML Config ) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Bean Lifecycle Methods / Hooks
------------------------------

We can add custome code during Bean Initialization : -----------

1. Custom Buisness logic.
2. Setting up to handle resources(db, sockets, file) etc.

	<bean id="" class="" init-method="methodName">

We can add custom code during Bean Destruction : -----------

1. Custom Buisness logic.
2. Clean up to handle resources(db, sockets, file) etc.

	<bean id="" class="" destroy-method="methodName">

Steps To Code
-------------

1. Define init and destroy methods.
2. COnfig them in spring config file.

***** Note 
----------

1. Access modifier of these methods : public/protected/private
2. Return type : Any but preferably void as return val cannot be captured
3. Arguments : None
4. Any name

Spring does not call destroy method when scope is prototype. It only calls the init method.

Look into the project :  destroy-prototype-scope-bean-with-custom-processor-xml-config in eclipse-workspace.

( Annotation Config ) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Use @Scope annotation

@Scope("singleton")
public class TennisCoach implements Coach{}

Bean Lifecycle Methods / Hooks
------------------------------

In annotation too, we can add custome code during Bean Initialization as also Bean Destruction.
We define init and destroy methods and use @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotation

@PostConstruct
public void afterCreate(){}

@PreDestroy
public void beforeDestroy(){}

Spring does not call destroy method when scope is prototype. It only calls the init method.
