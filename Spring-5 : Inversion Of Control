Inversion Of Control : IoC

Application will outsource the creation and management of objects and outsourcing will be handled by object factory.

Spring ask the object factory to give an object according to the configuration file or annotation. This makes the app 
configurable dynamically rather than hardcoding it.

Spring Container consists of the object factory. Its primary functions are : 
1. Create and manage objects (IoC)
2. Inject object's dependency. (Dependency injection);

Both are handled by Object Factory.

Configuring Spring Container
----------------------------
1. XML file (legacy) 2. Java Annotation (modern) 3. Java Source Code (modern)

Spring Development Process
--------------------------
1. Configure spring beans
2. Create spring container
3. Retrieve beans from spring container

(XML Config) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1. Configuring Sprinng Beans 
----------------------------

Spring Beans : java objects created by spring containers

<beans ...>
	<bean id="" class="" ></bean>
</beans

id : It is like an alias to represent this bean. It helps us to retrieve the bean from spring container.
class : Fully Qualified classname of implementation class.
 
2. Create spring container (known as Application Context)
---------------------------------------------------------

To read a xml config file,

ClassPathXMLApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXMLApplicationContext("appContext.xml");

appContext.xml is name of xml config file.

3. Retrieve Spring beans from container
---------------------------------------
In our example,

Coach coach = context.getBean("beanId","name of class or interface");

beanId : id of bean config
name of class or interface : For typecasting the bean into reqd class or interface.

					Using this, it provides a safety by throwing BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException if required type of bean is not retrieved.
Also it cannot throw ClassCastException on casting the class correctly.

(Annotation Config) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Special labels/marker added to java class which provide meta-data about the class are called annotation.
They are processed at compile-time or run-time.

E.g. : @Override -> compile time check

Why annotation config ?
-----------------------
> XML config is lot of writing or verbose. Annotation helps us to mminimize the xml config.

How it works ?
--------------

> Spring scans for special annotation through the java class. It then automatically register
the bean in Spring container.

Development Process
-------------------
1. Enable component scanning in Spring config file.
2. Add @Component annotation to java class.
3. Retrieve bean.

Enable component scanning in Spring config file
-----------------------------------------------

<beans>
	<context: component-scan base-package="package_name" /> 
		    : spring scans all class in this package and all of class in its sub-packages.
</beans>

Add @Component annotation to java class
---------------------------------------

@Component("id")
public  class MyCLass{}

@Component
Default component id : "myCLass" ( First letter of class name is lowercase )

If however class name is REConstruct, then default bean id is not rEConstruct as first two char
is uppercase. In such a  scenario, write @Component("someid")
